👤 Project By: Debyendu Saha
🛠️ Contribution: Individual
📌 Project Summary
This project analyzes a logistics dataset to uncover actionable insights for optimizing shipping operations, enhancing delivery performance, and managing freight costs.

Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical methods, and visualizations, the study provides the following key takeaways:

Shipment Mode & Timeliness:

Air freight is the most punctual but also the most expensive.

Sea freight offers cost savings but has higher delay rates.

Cost vs. Reliability:
A positive correlation suggests that higher freight costs are often linked to more reliable delivery performance.

Vendor Impact:
Vendor performance significantly affects delivery outcomes, emphasizing the need for reliable logistics partners.

Weight vs. Insurance:
A direct relationship is observed — heavier shipments tend to have higher insurance costs.
